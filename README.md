# Scheduling-Algorithms
This repo contains CPU scheduling algorithms simulated through CLI applications. The scheduling algorithms are written using C++ programming as a completion project for my operating systems class in Mapua University.

The repo contains the following scheduling algorithms:
 * <b>Multilevel Queue Algorithm</b> - contains a combination of FCFS, SJF_P, SJF_NP, P_P, P_NP, and RR algorithms.
 * <b>SJF_P_NP</b> - This only outputs Short-Job-First Preemptive and Non-Preemptive algorithm processes.
 * <b>P_P_NP</b> - This only outputs Priority Preemptive and Non-Preemptive algorithm processes.
