# Scheduling-Algorithms
This repo is for creating CPU scheduling algorithms shown through CLI applications. The scheduling algorithms are written using C++.

The contents of this repo contain the following:
 * <b>Multilevel Queue Algorithm</b> - contains a combination of FCFS, SJF_P, SJF_NP, P_P, P_NP, and RR algorithms.
 * SJF_P_NP - This only outputs Short-Job-First Preemptive and Non-Preemptive algorithm processes.
 * P_P_NP - This only outputs Priority Preemptive and Non-Preemptive algorithm processes.
